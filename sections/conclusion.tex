\section{Conclusion}
This work has provided a practical and theoretical understanding of the practices associated with the installation and secure configuration of virtualised servers and networks. In particular, when it came to dealing with specific issues of software where there were bugs and incompatible updates which led to difficulties that had to be worked around. This was not always straight forward but the desired end result was achieved.
