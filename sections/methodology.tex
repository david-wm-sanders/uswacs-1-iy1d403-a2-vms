\section{Methodology}
In this section of the report, I will detail the methodology that I used to setup the secure virtualised data centre environment. I will provide screenshots of important steps in the body of this section but will also reference additional screenshots (that are ancillary or large, and would disrupt a clean and concise presentation of the methodology) from Appendix~\ref{app:ancillaryscreenshots}.

While presenting the steps of the methodology, I will also discuss my reasoning for choosing this approach, explain where alternative approaches could be applied, describe the techniques that I used to secure the data centre environment, and identify further mechanisms for improving the security and resilience of the environment.

Notably, with regards to security, for the purposes of the setup of this demonstration environment I used similar passwords for ESXi, the server virtual machines inside ESXi, and the client machine. In a real world deployment of such an environment, all passwords should be unique and dissimilar insofar as the environment permits.
