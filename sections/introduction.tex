\section{Introduction}
In this assignment I created a virtualised environment with multiple servers. Different servers were available. As System Administrator, I was required to use the ESXi hypervisor in order to manage aspects including security, network connections, and failover to redundant servers.

This report details the processes I followed to complete the four tasks specified. It will serve as a `User Guide' to creating and configuration the environment in accordance with the instructions given in the project brief.
